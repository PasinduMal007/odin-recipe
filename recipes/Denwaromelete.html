    <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized
        flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a
        complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
        <dd>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</dd>
        <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
        <dd>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and
            pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</dd>
        <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
        <dd>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure
            ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese
            and cayenne pepper over omelet.</dd>
        <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
        <dd>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to
            fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</dd>
